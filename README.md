Correlation-One Weekly Project 13: Coding Accounts and Practice

I signed up for the free accounts on LeetCode, Hackerrank, and CodeWars. I forgot to add the very first coding problem prompt for the hackerrank problem 'solvemeFirst', but it is easy and self-explanatory.
I did not care much for LeetCode. I feel the presenation in wording in their coding problem prompts/challenges is not as smooth or immediately understandable, compared to Hackerrank and CodeWars. The challenges from hackerrank were beginner friendly, whereas CodeWars was somewhere in between. I do like the whole 'BloodSport' vibe they were going with in CodeWars.
Here in this repository I've added 3 folders, one for each site/account. And in each folder the code and prompts which I was presented with. In a way, this Project was doing extra practice like the Optional AELs modules in Codio from the lessons from class, only across 3 different sites/accounts. Will definitely go back to Hackerrank and CodeWars to practice some more problems.
